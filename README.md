# Python OOP Concepts

This repository contains Python source codes demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The examples are based on the video tutorial series: [Python OOP Playlist](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc?si=5irV7R8L_Any_ibk).

## Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. This repository includes various examples demonstrating OOP principles using Python.

---

## Classes and Objects
- Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
- Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that holds data and behavior defined by its class.

---

## Attributes and Methods
- Attributes: Variables that hold data related to a class and its instances. They describe the state or properties of an object.
- Methods: Functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors and actions of an object.

---

## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation restricts access to certain components of an object to protect its internal state.
- It can be achieved by using private and protected attributes, providing public methods to interact with these attributes.

---

## Inheritance
- Inheritance allows a new class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class).
- This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

---

## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism enables different classes to be treated as instances of a parent class.
- It allows methods in child classes to have the same name as those in the parent class but behave differently.

---

## Abstraction
- Abstraction focuses on exposing only essential features while hiding the internal implementation details.
- It helps in simplifying complex systems by providing a clear interface, often achieved through abstract classes and methods.
